# oscRepository
Repository for the C labs of the Operating Systems course of the Bachelor in Engineering Technology at KU Leuven.

There will be a distinction between homeworks, basic labs, project learning labs and the final project. 
The homeworks are just for setting up our Linux environment and dev tools for C. 
The basic C labs are meant to get familiar with C. At the end of these labs, there will be a first milestone.
The project learning labs tackle 4 key OS concepts we need for our final project: file I/O, inter-process communication, threads and thread synchronization.
During these learning libs we will create 4 subsystems of the project. After the second and the fourth lab there will be another milestone. 
The final project is a composition and integration of the code we worked on in the previous weeks.
